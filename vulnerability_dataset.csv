vulnerability,description
Memory Corruption,"Occurs when a program unintentionally alters the contents of a memory location, potentially leading to crashes or execution of arbitrary code."
SQL Injection,"Allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries made to a database by injecting malicious input, potentially leading to data breaches or privilege escalation."
Denial of Service (DoS),"Overloads a system with requests, causing it to become unresponsive or crash, often targeting network services or device drivers."
Privilege Escalation,"Allows attackers to gain higher-level access to a system than intended, potentially leading to full device control through improper permission handling."
Buffer Overflow,"Occurs when data exceeds a bufferâ€™s capacity, causing adjacent memory to be overwritten, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution."
Information Disclosure,"Allows unauthorized access to sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, or system logs, potentially leading to data theft."
Code Execution,"Allows attackers to run arbitrary code on the affected device, often through memory corruption or improper input validation, leading to full system compromise."
Bypass,"Allows attackers to circumvent security mechanisms such as authentication, sandboxing, or encryption, leading to unauthorized access or privilege escalation."
Directory Traversal,"Allows attackers to access directories and files outside the intended directories by manipulating file paths, potentially exposing sensitive data."
